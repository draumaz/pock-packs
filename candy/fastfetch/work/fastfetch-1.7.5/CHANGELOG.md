# 1.7.0

This release brings support for MacOS!  
The basics things are working, but it is far from feature parity with Linux.
I developed this in a VM, so bugs on real hardware are likely.
If you have a Mac and no idea what to do with your free time, i am very happy to accept pull requests / work on issues.

A lot of things were changed under the hood to make this possible, which should bring better performance and stability on all platforms. 

Besides that, the following things have changed:

Features:
* The binary prefix used can now be configured, and is used consistently across all modules. Set `--binary-prefix` to `iec` (default), `si` or `jedec`.
* AMD GPUs now have a much better name, if the file `/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids` exists. For example my dedicated GPU, which was displayed as `AMD/ATI Radeon RX 5600 OEM/5600 XT / 5700/5700 XT`, is now `AMD Radeon RX 5600M`.

Logos:
* MacOS
* CachyOS small (@sirlucjan, #220)
* MSYS2 (#219)

Bugfixes:
* the `--file` option, which can be used to display the contents of a file as the logo, is now working again.
